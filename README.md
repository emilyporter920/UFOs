## Summary
* One drawback of the website:
    * The one drawback of this website is that the table displays data that is not consistent. For example, in the [filtered search example](images/filter_example.png) the duration column either has the time labeled as mins., minut es, seconds, etc.

* Two additional recommendations:
    * The data should be uniform and use the same time incriments or at least use the same abbreviations between minutes and seconds. It is recommended that minutes is abbreviated to 'min' and seconds is abbreviated to 's'.
    * The filter search text boxes are different lengths, it would look better if the search text boxes all lined up and had the same length throughout.
